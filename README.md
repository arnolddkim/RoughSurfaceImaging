# RoughSurfaceImaging
SAR imaging below a random rough surface

This collection of Matlab codes were used to compute the simulation results contained in the manuscript "Synthetic aperture radar imaging below a random rough surface" by A. D. Kim and C. Tsogka.

The code "BistaticXSect.m" is the main driver to compute the bistatic cross-section for the random rough surfaces used in this study. It produces the plots corresponding to Fig. 2 in the manuscript.

The code "RoughSurfaceImaging1Target.m" is the main driver to compute the simulated measurements and resulting images of a single subsurface target. It produces the plots corresponding to Figs. 3 -- 9 of the manuscript.

The code "RoughSurfaceImaging3Targets.m" is the main driver to compute the simulated measurements and resulting images of three subsurface targets. It produces the plots corresponding to Figs. 10 and 11 of the manuscript.
